"""
opentcad/process/topography/mesh_bridge.py — TopographyState → MeshField.

Turns the stack of ViennaLS level-sets produced by simulate() into the
same MeshField the device layer already consumes:

    TopographyState (viennals Domains, stacked bottom-first)
        │
        │  for each layer's top LS: ToSurfaceMesh → polyline (nodes, lines)
        │
        ▼
    single-valued top curves y_i(x), one per material
        │
        │  gmsh: build one 2D surface per material, bounded above by
        │        y_i(x) and below by y_{i-1}(x) (or the domain floor)
        │
        ▼
    triangular mesh with cell_data["material_id"]

MVP assumptions (loosened as we add anisotropic etch / re-entrant profiles):
  * top surfaces are single-valued: y is a function of x. That's true for
    isotropic deposit and isotropic etch of a flat wafer up to the point
    the etch bottoms out into a lower material — we bail with a clear
    error rather than silently produce a bogus mesh.
  * the simulation window (state.bounds_um) is a rectangle.
  * material stack is strictly ordered — layer[i] sits fully above the
    interface with layer[i-1].
